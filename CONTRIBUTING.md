#How to contribute

##Issues

If you've found a problem with — or some gaps in — any of our data then you can let us know by [raising an issue](/edinburghcouncil/datasets/issues/new) and we'll take a look at it when we can.

Alternatively, if you've got the technical knowledge and can help us improve our data to fix any mistakes that have been found then that's even better! Read [GitHub's help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) if want to help but don't yet know how.

- Create your own named branch

		git checkout -b my-branch

- Make the edits to correct the data on your branch.

- Commit your changes

		git commit -am 'Fixed these errors <list>'

- Push to the branch

		git push origin my-branch

- Return to GitHub and submit a [pull request](/edinburghcouncil/datasets/pulls). We'll review your submission and, if everything looks good, we'll merge it into our master branch and close any associated issues.


##Discussion

Issues are also used here as a place for wider discussion and debate around Council data and how GitHub can be best used. Just [add a new issue](/edinburghcouncil/datasets/issues/new) to start a new topic or suggestion and weigh in with your opinions.
