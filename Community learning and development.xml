It is a feminine, powerful and joyful art that can help you improve your well-being and build self-confidence.

look after ourselves as well as we should do and our health suffers. Thatâs
life and thereâs no reason to give yourself a hard time for letting it get to this stage. Itâs all about feeling proud that youâve decided to make a change and are committed to improving your health. Losing weight can have a hugely positive impact on your life and can be life changing for some people so letâs not feel negative about being on a weight loss programme, letâs get excited about what may come of it!

All we ask from you over the next 8 weeks is to commit yourself fully to this programme and work on integrating all the skills and tools you will learn into your daily routines. We will provide you with a weight loss plan that will help you manage a healthy lifestyle for the rest of your life whilst enjoying the foods that you love. This is not a restricted diet, bootcamp or unhealthy regime that you will struggle with â this is all about fitting simple and effective habits into your day with a new attitude to back it up.

GENERAL AIM OF THE COURSE: To introduce students to, and to progress with practice of yoga, with an associated broadening of understanding of health, self and mind. 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
By the end of the course students will have: - learned what yoga means and what benefits it can bring to physical health and mental well-being; - knowledge of a greater range of physical postures and an improvement of quality of these postures; - enhanced understanding of bond between body and mind; - learned how access into knowledge of the mind can be achieved through work with the body. 
GENERAL APPROACH TO THE COURSE: A series of one and half hour classes focussing mainly on physical postures, with possible occasional work with sound and some brief investigations into philosophy.

Other equipment such as belts, blocks and bricks may be required and information on these will be given by tutor in the class.  HOWEVER students may wish to wait until the class commences to get information/advice from tutor before purchasing costly materials and also to confirm viability of class.

Â WHAT THIS COURSE WILL NOT DO
This course will not advise you how to cast your ballot in 2014: nor will it

Tell you how much better off/ worse off you would be under independence
Tell you what kind of health/ education/ defence/ or whatever system would exist under independence. 

But it will discuss the historical background to Scottish politics and culture, the issues facing Scotland in the referendum and the possible consequences of different outcomes in the referendum. The course is delivered by lectures supported by power-point presentation and hand-outs.  Discussion, debate and the sharing of ideas and good practice are actively encouraged.  There will be a small amount of advised reading to support studentsâ learning. 
THIS COURSE IS FREE
